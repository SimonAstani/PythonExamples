Online Python Quiz for Beginners – Python Classes and Objects
Python Quiz | By Meenakshi Agarwal
We’ve curated this online Python quiz for beginners learning Python programming.

It enlists 20 questions on Python classes and objects.

It’s easy to define a class in Python using the <class> keyword. Check out a simple class definition below.

class TestClass:

    '''It is a doc string. I've implemented a new class.'''
   pass

In the above code, you can see the highlighted doc string specifying the description of the class.

Let’s now see a little more about classes before moving on to the quiz.

Basics Of Python Classes.
In Python, every class has a local namespace to define all its members which could either be functions or variables. Also, every Python class holds a set of special attributes. Each of them starts and ends with a double underscore sign (__). If you consider the above example, then using the __doc__ will return the doc string of that class.

Once you have the class defined, it is easy to instantiate it anytime. You can use a class object to reference any of its attributes. Let’s see a simple example to define the class instance.

>>> myObj = TestClass()
Like constructors in C++, we’ve __init__() method in Python. This function gets called every time you instantiate the class. Please refer the below example to view a complete Python class.

class EmployeeData:

    def __init__(self, sal=0, age=0):
        self.sal = sal
        self.age = age

    def getData(self):
        print("{0}+{1}j".format(self.sal,self.age))
