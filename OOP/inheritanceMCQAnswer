1. Which of the following best describes inheritance?
a)	Ability of a class to derive members of another class as a part of its own definition
b)	Means of bundling instance variables and methods in order to restrict access to certain class members
c)	Focuses on variables and passing of variables to functions
d)	Allows for implementation of elegant software that is well designed and easily modified

Answer: a
Explanation: If the class definition is class B(A): then class B inherits the methods of class A. This is called inheritance.

2.What is the output of the following piece of code?

class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
class Derived_Test(Test):
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = 1
def main():
    b = Derived_Test()
    print(b.x,b.y)
main()
a)	0 1
b)	0 0
c) Error because class B inherits A but variable x isn’t inherited
d)	Error because when object is created, argument must be passed like Derived_Test(1)

Answer: c
Explanation: Since the invoking method, Test.__init__(self), isn’t present in the derived class, variable x can’t be inherited.

3. When defining a subclass in Python that is meant to serve as a subtype, the subtype Python keyword is used. Is the statement true or false?
a)	True
b)	False

Answer: b
Explanation: B is a subtype of B if instances of type B can substitute for instances of type A without affecting semantics.

4.	What is the output of the following piece of code?

class A:
     def __init__(self):
         self.__i = 1
         self.j = 5

     def display(self):
         print(self.__i, self.j)
class B(A):
     def __init__(self):
         super().__init__()
         self.__i = 2
         self.j = 7
c = B()
c.display()

a)	2 7
b)	1 5
c)	1 7
d)	2 5

Answer: c
Explanation: Any change made in variable i isn’t reflected as it is the private member of the superclass.

5. Method issubclass() checks if a class is a subclass of another class. True or False?
a)	True
b)	False

Answer: a
Explanation: Method issubclass() returns True if a class is a subclass of another class and False otherwise.


6. What is the output of the following piece of code?

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__x = 1
class B(A):
    def display(self):
        print(self.__x)
def main():
    obj = B()
    obj.display()
main()
a)	1
b)	0
c)	Error, invalid syntax for object declaration
d)	Error, private class member can’t be accessed in a subclass

Answer: d
Explanation: Private class members in the superclass can’t be accessed in the subclass.


7. What is the output of the following piece of code?

class A:
    def test1(self):
        print(" test of A called ")
class B(A):
    def test(self):
        print(" test of B called ")
class C(A):
    def test(self):
        print(" test of C called ")
class D(B,C):
    def test2(self):
        print(" test of D called ")
obj=D()
obj.test()
a)	test of B called
test of C called
b)	test of C called
test of B called
c)	test of B called
d)	Error, both the classes from which D derives has same method test()


Answer: c
Explanation: Execute in Python shell to verify. If class D(B,C): is switched is class D(C,B): test of C is called.

8.	Which of the following statements isn’t true?
a)	A non-private method in a superclass can be overridden
b)	A derived class is a subset of superclass
c)	The value of a private variable in the superclass can be changed in the subclass
d)	When invoking the constructor from a subclass, the constructor of superclass is automatically invoked

Answer: c
Explanation: If the value of a private variable in a superclass is changed in the subclass, the change isn’t reflected.
